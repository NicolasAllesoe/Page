Our overall aim is to identify causal factors and objective markers for mental disorders - paving the way for more precise diagnostics, prevention and treatment strategies â€“ while increasing our insight into biological and behavioral mechanisms of mental disorders.  
We work from Big Data to deeply phenotyped data, utilizing the nationwide Danish registers, large-scale genetic data, population-based electronic health records, biobank samples, and data from clinical studies and trials, including digital phenotyping.  
We have a strong focus on ImmunoPsychiatry identifying immunological factors causing or contributing to mental disorders, in addition to more broad investigations of biomarkers and biological systems. The co-morbidity patterns between general medical conditions and mental disorders are investigated from epidemiological to genetic contributions to the associations.  
To disentangle the complexity of mental disorders, we are leveraging on privileged access to large amounts of data and novel data analytical approaches as machine learning. This is used to integrate multiple objective measures to identify objective markers and develop prediction and stratification models to help improve treatments based on the magnitude of health care workers.  
Our overall goals are to enable more precision psychiatry improving diagnostics, clinical decision making and treatment response.
