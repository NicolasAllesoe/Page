  <p style="float:left; width:75%">Lorem  Ipsum  is  simply  dummy  text  of  the  printing  and  typesetting  industry.  Lorem 
        Ipsum  has  been  the  industry's  standard  dummy  text  ever  since  the  1500s,  when  an 
        unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br> It 
        has  survived  not  only  five  centuries,  but  also  the  leap  into  electronic  typesetting, 
        remaining  essentially  unchanged. <br>It  was  popularised  in  the  1960s  with  the  release  of 
        Letraset  sheets  containing  Lorem  Ipsum  passages,  and  more  recently  with  desktop 
        publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br></p>
