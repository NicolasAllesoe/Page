    <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Lorem  Ipsum  is  simply  dummy  text  of  the  printing  and  typesetting  industry.  Lorem 
        Ipsum  has  been  the  industry's  standard  dummy  text  ever  since  the  1500s,  when  an 
        unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br> It 
        has  survived  not  only  five  centuries,  but  also  the  leap  into  electronic  typesetting, 
        remaining  essentially  unchanged. <br>It  was  popularised  in  the  1960s  with  the  release  of 
        Letraset  sheets  containing  Lorem  Ipsum  passages,  and  more  recently  with  desktop 
        publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br>
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a 
        page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-
        less  normal  distribution  of  letters,  as  opposed  to  using  'Content  here,  content  here', 
        making  it  look  like  readable  English.<br> Many  desktop  publishing  packages  and  web  page 
        editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' 
        will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the 
        years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
